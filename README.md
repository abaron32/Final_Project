# Uruguayan media press analysis

In this project we build economic policy uncertainty indexes (following Becerra et al (2020) and Baker 
et al (2016)) and analyze sentiments and topics using tweets from the media press in Uruguay from March 
2022 to August 2022. In order to make good policy decisions, policymakers need timeliness and frequent information, 
but many economic indicators are published with considerable lags and monthly or quarterly frequency. Natural language processing techniques allows us to 
summarize information from the social media Twitter and contribute to the decision-making process with timeliness 
indicators.

The database includes 112.237 tweets from nine media press users from Uruguay and was created using the Twitter API.

The results can be seen [here](https://tweets-media-press.herokuapp.com/). 

This work was presented as the final project of the 4Geeks Academy Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence bootcamp.
